# MyST Enhancement Proposals (MEPs)

**IN DEVELOPMENT**

This repository contains enhancement proposals for the MyST documentation language.

It is, similar to [PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)
and also taking inspiration the way the [Jupyter project deals with enhancement proposals](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals).

The purpose is to publicly discuss new features & design choices in the MyST ecosystem and to document the decision making process.


## TODO

- Move repo to https://github.com/executablebooks/myst-eps
- Add `@executablebooks/mep-editors` GitHub team
- implement https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners
- change `[myst implementation]: https://github.com/executablebooks/mystjs` in `0001.md`
- add discussions-to link to `0001.md`
